# 16bit-pipelined-RISC-processor-using-Verilog-HDL
- Developed a new Reduced Instruction Set with least possible no. of instructions in it such that the designed
 Processor can be used to implement almost any Function by combination of instructions
– Implemented the Processor using Verilog HDL in Xilinx Vivado
– In the process of Designing the processor, I have implemented many smaller components like 16-bit adder, Decoders,
     Register file, Stack Pointer, Program Counter, ALU and finally integrating everything as processor by designing
     Control Unit, buses, instruction registers, etc
– Using the concept of pipelining divided execution of instruction in several stages such that approximately one
     instruction is executed for every clock cycle
